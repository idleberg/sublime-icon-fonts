Deprecated Icon Fonts
=====================

This is a reminder that as of v3.0.0 several icon fonts have been removed from
this package:

- Elegant Theme Line Icons
- Foundation Icons 1.0
- Glyphicons Filetypes
- Glyphicons Halflings
- Glyphicons Pro
- Glyphicons Social

If you need support for any of the removed icons, you can install them from the
separate "Icon Fonts (Legacy)" from within Package Contol.
